## Summary of what I learnt every session

### 1st session: Fundamentals of coding with Python

- Today we learnt about the Fundamentals of coding using Python, we went through the data types, operators, variables, printing and inputs.

### 2nd session: Fundamentals of coding with Python continued (Syntax and lists)

- Today was very comprehensive, we covered overall Python syntax which I will outline below in a very concise way. I also learnt about Lists as a ordered Data structure, with associated built-in methods. Next week we move on to Functions, if statement, for and while loops.... exciting stuff!

### 3rd Session: Fundamentals of coding with Python continued - Lists, Tuples and Sets
Seems we are getting into the meats and bones of Data structures, I am enjoying it so far (might not be saying the same once we get into for-loops haha). 

- My summary of this is Lists are like JavaScript Arrays, Tuples are immutable so you have to change them to lists before you can use them and Sets are like a mixture of both qualities of tuples and lists. Bring on the For-loops !

### 4th Session: Fundamentals of coding with Python continued - Dictionaries, Conditional statements and  Functions

We went through dictionaries which are key-value pair data structures, 
if statements and for loops. I actually quite enjoy using for-loops in python (JavaScript is a whole other thing lol). We also went through the basics of functions and how they are simply reusable code, I think it is all going to come together once we go through Object Orientated programming with classes and objects. 

### 5th Session: Fundamentals of coding with Python continued - List, Dictionary comprehension and Debugging your code

Finishing up Data Structures overview with List and Dictionary Comprehension. I am going to be very honest and confess that this final part still goes over my head, I get the individual components (for loops and if statements) but for some reason when they come together it becomes a bit blurry. I'm just going to have to practice them a lot more. The rest of the session was spent examining the stack trace and how to debug your code, which I think is a super vital part of being a programmer. We learnt some of the different types of errors and what they mean, I have made notes about them :)
