### The Cloud Adoption Framework (Microsoft)

Cloud Adoption Framework is a mechanism that involves process, people and technology that is designed to take you from the start of thinking of moving to the cloud to being able to drop yoour microservices into a secure and governed cloud environment. 

1. Define strategy (Define business justification and expected outcomes - why do you want to move to the cloud?)
2. Plan (Align actionable cloud adoption plan to business outcomes)
3. Ready (Prepare people, process and environment for change)
4. Adopt (Implement desired changes across IT and business processes)
5. Govern (Comply, control and secure)
6. Manage (Operate and optimize)
