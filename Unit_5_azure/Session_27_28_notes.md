## 27th Session and 28th Session: Azure Fundamentals: DevOps

DevOps is the collaboration between software developers and IT operations with the goal of delivering high-quality software that solves customer challenges. DevOps creates a culture and an environment where building, testing, and releasing software happens rapidly, frequently, and more consistently.

Continuous Delivery, enabled by Agile product development practices, is the process of moving incremental software changes into production constantly through automation. Continuous delivery makes the act of releasing software dull and reliable, so organizations can deliver software more frequently with less riskâ€”and get feedback faster.
