## Summary of what I learnt in this unit - Introduction to Design Principles

### 7th Session: Unit 2: Design Principles (Object Oriented Programming)

Today we looked at Design Principles, how to build a class and an object in more detail. It took a while to get the difference between the two but I think I finally understand it, I will attempt to explain it below :)

From my understanding, 
- Everything is an Object (In python)
- An Object is a collection of data variables (attributes) and functions (methods)
- A class is a blueprint used to create object, the class defines the atrributes and methods that each object has
- An Instance is an object created from a class
