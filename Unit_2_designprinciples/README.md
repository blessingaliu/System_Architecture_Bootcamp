## Summary of what I learnt in this unit - Introduction to Design Principles

### 7th Session: Unit 2: Design Principles (Object Oriented Programming)

Today we looked at Design Principles, how to build a class and an object in more detail. It took a while to get the difference between the two but I think I finally understand it, I will attempt to explain it below :)

From my understanding, 
- Everything is an Object (In python)
- An Object is a collection of data variables (attributes) and functions (methods)
- A class is a blueprint used to create object, the class defines the atrributes and methods that each object has
- An Instance is an object created from a class


### 8th Session: Working with Modules in Python

Learnt about modules and importing them into source files.


# 9th and 10th Session: Understanding Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation and Polymorphism in OOP

This has to be the most confusing topic so far, I guess I am still getting my head around each of these software pillars but definitely more practice is needed ü•≤

**Abstraction**:
This is about only showing relevant information and the hiding the unnecessary parts.

Abstraction is the process of taking away or removing characteristics from something in order to reduce it to a set of essential characteristics.

Abstraction in programming often means hiding the internal implementation details to only provide relevant information for the user of the application.


**Inheritance**:

Inheritance is where one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. The class that inherits is the child class and other one is the parent class.
When a child class inherits from a parent class, the child acquires all behaviors from the parent. It allows reusability.

Inheritance says ‚Äúis a.‚Äù E.g. The car is a vehicle.
Inheritance: To design a class on what it is.


**Encapsulation**:
Within a class, we would encapsulate properties and methods belonging to that class. Encapsulation is the process of combining properties and methods into a single unit (class) and ‚Äúhiding‚Äù these details under the hood of abstraction.

In Encapsulation, the data is not accessed directly; it is accessed through the functions present inside the class. In simpler words, attributes of the class are kept private and public getter and setter methods are provided to manipulate these attributes 



**Polymorphism**:
The word polymorphism is made of two words poly and morph, where poly means many and morphs means forms.
