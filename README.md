## Software development and Systems Architecture Bootcamp with Niyo Enterprise 

I am just using this as an outlet to document my journey ups and downs throughout this bootcamp learning how to become job ready as a Solutions or Software Architect.

This is a 30 week Bootcamp of part-time learning (evenings, online, 6pm-9pm, 2 sessions per week on Tuesdays and Thursdays) to acquire the necessary skills for System Architecture & Software Development. In total there are 60 sessions, about 40 sessions are dedicated to Microservices Architecture and AWS Architecture.

To note, this course requires some coding experience and a willingness to become a AWS Architects.

The Course overview is as follows:

**Unit 1: The Fundamentals of Coding with Python**

**Unit 2: Introduction to Design Principles**

**Unit 3: Web Application & Software Architecture**

**Unit 4: Build a Backend REST API with python**

**Unit 5: Microservice Architecture: Practical Implementation**

**Unit 6: AWS Architecture**

**Unit 7: Preparing for System Designs Interview**

I am super excited to embark on this journey of learning and I will be making a single post for each of the sessions documenting my learning and progression. Feel free to drop me a question if you have any. I will see you in the next post :)
