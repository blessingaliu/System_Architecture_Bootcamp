## 18th Session: REST API Introduction: Asynchronous web apps

Asynchronous programming **provides opportunities for a program to continue running other code while waiting for a long-running task to complete**. The time-consuming task is executed in the background while the rest of the code continues to execute.

- it allows a user to go about his business in an application, while processes run in the background

## Concurrent vs parallel programming

- *Concurrency* involves allowing multiple jobs to take turns accessing the same shared resources, like disk, network, or a single CPU core
- Parallelism is about allowing several tasks to run side by side on independently partitioned resources, like multiple CPU cores. Two or actions executing simultaneously.
