## 17th Session: REST API Introduction

### REST

Architectural style for designing APIs 

- **Architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data**
- REST APIs are scalable and stateless, you don’t have to worry about what state your data is in or track it b/w client or server
- An API for a website is code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other. It acts as a middle man when the two parties cannot communicate directly

`API uses GET` **to read(retrieve) information from one party and gives information to the other party**

`API uses POST` **to send data and create a new resource.**

`API uses PUT`**to send data to edit/update an existing resource**

`API uses DELETE` **to remove resources**
